# XQJ RI
This is a copy of Oracle's XQJ RI (XQuery for Java Reference Implementation).

The code was downloaded from the JCP page [JSR-000225 XQuery API for Java (Final Release)](https://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/final/jsr225/index.html),
specifically the file [xqjri-20080114-133351.zip](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/features/xmldb/xqjri-20080114-133351.zip). 

The [license](LICENSE) for the RI has some similarity to a conventional BSD-style open source license.
